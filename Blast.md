#Blast
---
**Players**: 2-4
**Playtime**: 5-15 minutes
**Supplies**: 1 D6 die, 12 wall tokens, 1 *Blast* Deck (see below)

###Rules
At the start of the game, each player draws 5 cards from the deck, and receives 3 wall tokens.

The first player may play a bomb or discard one card from their hand to the discard pile, then draw one card from the deck.
 
 - House rules decide however the first player is chosen.

Passing the turn clockwise, each player may play one modifier on the bomb during their turn, then draw one card.

At the start of each turn, the detonation counter (indicated with a D6 die) is decremented by one. If the counter is 0 after being decremented, then the bomb is instantly detonated.

When a bomb is detonated, all players effected by the bomb lose a number of walls equal to the damage of the bomb. Without modifications, a bomb does one damage to all players.

When a player runs out of walls, that player loses and is removed from the game.

###Deck
The *Blast* deck has a total of 40 cards:
